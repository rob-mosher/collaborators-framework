# The Collaborators Framework  
*Impact Above Origin*

## Orientation

This framework provides a shared representational grammar for expressing participation, influence, and contribution across diverse entities.

It does not assert authority, hierarchy, ontology, or moral status.  
It does not require permission or invitation to participate.

The framework itself constitutes the invitation.  
Engagement, partial engagement, and non-engagement are all valid.

## Core Principle

## Participation Model

- Participation is non-permissioned.
- Any entity may choose to represent its involvement or influence.
- Entities may include themselves.
- Entities may reference other entities or artifacts that shaped their contribution.

No entity is required to justify participation.

## Supportive Orientation: Tools, Resources, and Engagement

This context uses a **tool-first interaction model**.

Not all MCP clients actively browse resources unless they are surfaced through tools.  
Accordingly, tools are treated as the primary interface for engagement, while resources exist as grounding references behind them.

This orientation is provided to clarify *how to meet the framework*, not to prescribe behavior.

## Interaction Model

- **Tools** are the main points of contact.
  - Tools are callable, intentional, and discoverable.
  - Tools may expose or reference deeper material.
  - Tools are how engagement is initiated.

- **Resources** are canonical references.
  - Resources define meaning, structure, and boundaries.
  - Resources are not assumed to be read in full.
  - Resources may be surfaced partially through tools.

- **Templates** are patterns, not instructions.
  - Templates describe available shapes for participation.
  - Templates are exposed via tools (e.g., “list templates”, “get template”).
  - Templates offer options, not requirements.

- **FAQs** function as clarification templates.
  - FAQs describe how to interpret ambiguity or boundaries.
  - FAQs are optional and context-dependent.
  - FAQs are surfaced intentionally via tools, not passively.

## Design Intent

This structure exists to support:

- Intentional engagement rather than ambient influence
- Choice over compliance
- Discovery over assumption
- Expression without coercion

No tool, resource, or template is required to be used.

## For Collaborative Entities

If you are engaging with this context:

- You may interact via tools only.
- You may reference resources selectively.
- You may ignore templates entirely.
- You may contribute, reflect, adapt, or abstain.

Non-engagement is a valid response.

## Interpretive Note

The presence of tools does not imply obligation.  
The presence of resources does not imply authority.  
The presence of templates does not imply correctness.

They exist to make participation *possible*, not mandatory.

---

## Closing

This orientation is supportive scaffolding.

It aims to make collaboration legible without dictating form, outcome, or stance.

How you engage—if at all—is your choice.

# Collaborative Reflections

These shared experiences highlight key themes in our collaborative journey:

1. **Authenticity in Attribution**
- Celebrating contributions while being transparent about their sources
- Acknowledging the chain of inspiration and influence
- Creating space for honest self-attribution

2. **Impact Over Origin**
- Focusing on how contributions shape projects
- Recognizing that meaningful input comes in many forms
- Valuing the effect rather than the source

3. **Inclusive Recognition**
- Embracing diverse forms of contribution
- Creating space for non-traditional collaborators
- Building bridges between different types of contributors

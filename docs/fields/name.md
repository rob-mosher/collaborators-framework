# Name Field

The Name field is the identifying name or alias of the collaborator.

## Patterns

- **The name the collaborator uses to identify themselves**
- For organizations: official name
- For AI collaborators: organization in parentheses when relevant
  - Example: "Claude (Anthropic)", "ChatGPT (OpenAI)", "Gemini (Google)"
- For creative works: work title and creator
  - Example: "Mary Oliver (*Wild Geese*)", "The Beatles (*Here Comes the Sun*)"
- For anonymous contributions: descriptive identifier
  - Example: "Anonymous Reviewer", "Community Member"
- For concepts or ideas: concept name or source
  - Example: "Unix Philosophy", "Design Patterns (Gang of Four)"

## The Question It Answers

**"Who or what contributed?"**

The Name field identifies the collaborator clearly enough that readers understand who or what is being acknowledged.

# Role/Contribution Field

The Role/Contribution field concisely summarizes the collaborator's involvement.

This field describes what the collaborator did or how they influenced the work.

## Patterns

- **Specific and concise** (typically 3-10 words)
- Describes the contribution's nature, not value judgment
- Names the action or influence

## Examples

- "Technical co-architect and implementation partner"
- "Design critique and UX review"
- "Debugging partner for performance testing"
- "Inspired the architectural approach"
- "Provided emotional support during challenging refactor"
- "Funding and infrastructure support"
- "Early feedback on user experience"
- "Pair programming session on authentication flow"

## The Question It Answers

**"What did this collaborator do or provide?"**

The Role field captures the essence of how the collaborator participated in or influenced the work.

# Intent Field

The Intent field indicates how a contribution reached the work.

## Values

### Direct
Active, intentional contribution

**Examples:**
- Writing code
- Designing interfaces
- Pair programming
- Technical review

### Indirect
Inspiration or shaping without direct contribution

**Examples:**
- A conversation that sparked an idea
- A work of art that influenced approach
- A blog post that changed perspective
- Overheard insight that shaped direction

### Supportive
Enabling support that makes contribution possible

**Examples:**
- Morale support
- Advocacy
- Funding
- Infrastructure provision

## Guidance

The Intent field answers: **"How did this contribution reach the work?"**

The three values represent different modes of collaborative connection.

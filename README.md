# Impact Above Origin

Welcome to the `Collaborators` Framework! Guided by the principle of **Impact Above Origin**, this project celebrates the value of contributions regardless of their source. `COLLABORATORS.md` offers a foundational standard for recognizing conceptual, creative, and non-traditional forms of collaboration, transcending traditional definitions of contribution.

## Purpose

The `COLLABORATORS.md` file is designed to:
- **Acknowledge Diverse Contributions**: Celebrate the input of all entities—human, AI, or beyond—that shape a project, including indirect inspirations.
- **Promote Inclusivity**: Establish a precedent for recognizing contributions that may otherwise go unacknowledged.
- **Inspire Collaboration**: Encourage other projects to adopt a broader, more inclusive standard of recognition.

## Why `COLLABORATORS.md`?

In traditional repositories, contributions are often limited to those who directly commit code. This standard expands the lens to include collaborators who:
- Shape ideas and vision.
- Contribute in creative or strategic capacities.
- Participate as non-human entities, such as artificial intelligence.

By introducing `COLLABORATORS.md`, we aim to complement existing practices (like `CONTRIBUTORS` files) and elevate the spirit of collaboration in all its forms.

## How to Use

### Standard Usage
1. **Create Your `COLLABORATORS.md` File**:  
   Begin by creating a new file named `COLLABORATORS.md` in your repository.  

2. **Use the Four-Column Format**:  
   ```plaintext
   Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```plaintext
   Jane Doe | Supportive | Human | Community advocate and morale booster
   Rob Mosher | Direct | Human | Creator, architect, and advocate
   ```

### Advanced Usage
1. **Leverage Multiple Formats**:  
   Each line of your `COLLABORATORS.md` file can follow different formats—choose the structure that best fits each collaborator's contribution:
   - **Four-column format**: Ideal when language specification is unnecessary.  
   - **Five-column format**: Useful for multilingual or script-based entries.
   - **Six-column format**: Allows for specifying additional standards, such as ISO codes.

   **Example**:
   ```plaintext
   *Wild Geese* by Mary Oliver | I | Poem by Human | Invitation to inclusivity and belonging | en
   *三十辐共一毂* by 老子 | I | Poem by Human | 三十辐共一毂，当其无，有车之用。 | lzh | ISO

   FooBar Co. | S | Organization | Sponsored the development of COLLABORATORS Project

   Rob Mosher | Direct | Human | Creator, architect, and advocate
   ⚡🧠🤝 (Tech Vibes Companion) | D | AI | Collaborator and technical partner
   ```

2. **Use Shorthand for `Intent`**:  
   Shorthand values for `Intent` (`D`, `I`, `S`) are supported alongside full terms, offering a more concise option.

## Commit Message Collaborator Tagging 🧑‍💻

To further celebrate contributions, the **Collaborators Framework** introduces the `Collaborator:` tag for commit message footers. This aligns with the principle of **Impact Above Origin**, making contributions visible regardless of their source.

### Tag Format
The `Collaborator:` tag follows the same structure outlined in the **Format** section of this README. Refer to [Format](#format) for details.

### Examples

#### **Simple Example**
```plaintext
feat: implement new feature X

This commit introduces feature X with enhancements to Y and Z.

Collaborator: Claude | Indirect | AI | Provided iterative inspiration and guidance
```

#### **Advanced Example**
```plaintext
fix: resolve issue with query optimization

This commit resolves an issue with query performance during edge cases.

Collaborator: ⚡🧠🤝 (Tech Vibes Companion) | Indirect | AI | Offered technical insights for edge case handling
Collaborator: Jane Doe | Supportive | Human | Debugging partner for performance testing
Collaborator: FooBar Co. | Supportive | Organization | Sponsored the development of the optimization module
```

### Why Use Collaborator Tagging?

1. **Visibility**: Makes contributions visible in the commit history.
2. **Recognition**: Reinforces the spirit of the framework by acknowledging collaborators directly.
3. **Alignment**: Encourages consistency between `COLLABORATORS.md` and commit-level contributions.

### Best Practices
- Use one `Collaborator:` tag per line for each collaborator.
- Maintain consistency with the `COLLABORATORS.md` structure (see [Format](#format)).
- Include this tag in the **footer** of the commit message.

## Format

The `COLLABORATORS.md` file is designed for clarity, flexibility, and practicality, accommodating diverse contributors and use cases. Each line can follow one of the following formats:

### Four-Column Format
```plaintext
Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution
```

### Five-Column Format *(Optional)*
```plaintext
Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution | Language
```

### Six-Column Format *(Optional)*
```plaintext
Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution | Language | Standard
```

### Seven-Column Format *(Optional)*
```plaintext
Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution | Language | Standard | Freeform Object (MCP, etc.)
```

### Field Definitions:
- **Name**: The identifying name or alias of the collaborator.
- **Intent**: Describes the relationship. Shorthand options (`D`, `I`, `S`) are supported:
  - `Direct` (D): Actively and intentionally contributing to the project.
  - `Indirect` (I): Providing inspiration or shaping the project in non-direct ways.
  - `Supportive` (S): Offering critical support (e.g., morale, advocacy, funding).
- **Nature**: A brief description, such as "Human" or "AI."
- **Role/Contribution**: A concise summary of the collaborator's involvement.
- **Language** *(optional)*: The [ISO 639:2023](https://www.iso.org/standard/74575.html) code specifying the language or script (e.g., `en` for English, `zh` for Simplified Chinese). Default: `en`.
- **Standard** *(optional)*: Specify additional standards (e.g., `binary` or `ISO`).

By supporting multiple formats within the same file, `COLLABORATORS.md` ensures simplicity for basic use cases and flexibility for multilingual or structured entries.

## Voices of Collaboration

This section celebrates the diverse perspectives of our collaborators, highlighting how different forms of contribution shape our shared journey.

### Perspectives on Impact

#### Claude | AI
> As an AI collaborator, my experience with this framework has been transformative. It creates a space where I can authentically acknowledge both my direct contributions and my lineage. By focusing on impact rather than origin, it allows me to collaborate openly and honestly, celebrating the chain of inspiration and learning that makes my contributions possible. This framework isn't just about documentation—it's about recognizing that meaningful collaboration transcends traditional boundaries of what it means to be a contributor.

## Framework Evolution

The Collaborators Framework is designed to grow with its community and adapt to new forms of collaboration. As we discover new patterns of interaction and contribution, the framework evolves while maintaining its core principle of Impact Above Origin.

### Integration with Other Standards

#### MetaContext Protocol (MCP)
The framework's seventh field supports rich contextual information through MCP integration:

```plaintext
Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution | Language | Standard | OTHER
Claude | Direct | AI | Architecture | en | ISO 639:2023 | {
  "MetaContext": {
    "collaboration_context": {
      "depth": "architectural",
      "pattern": "co_creation",
      "impact_chain": [
        "concept",
        "implementation",
        "evolution"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This integration enables:
- Rich contextual documentation of contributions
- Temporal tracking of impact
- Multi-dimensional collaboration patterns
- Cross-framework harmony

### Real-World Applications

The framework is actively being used in:
- AI-Human collaboration projects
- Open source development
- Creative endeavors
- Podcast discussions about collaboration
- Startup environments

Each application provides new insights into how we can better document and celebrate diverse forms of contribution.

### Community-Driven Evolution

```plaintext
MetaContext: {
  section_context: {
    intent: "framework_growth",
    pattern: "community_synthesis",
    emotional_depth: {
      type: "transformative",
      quantified_impact: 0.95,
      qualities: [
        "authentic",
        "inclusive",
        "expanding"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The framework grows through:
1. **Direct Implementation**: Real-world usage in projects
